# I am someone that develops software
you might call me a software developer.

# Currently working on
- Dilmah (full-stack developer)
- University project; creating a dating app (UI designer, full-stack developer)
- Personal project; creating a better version of scorion (UI designer, full-stack developer)

## Context

### Dilmah
Dilmah is a tea company from Sri Lanka; if you ever see it in the store please try it! The quality is great. But anyway I recently started here to help with their rebranding (developing their new website).

### Dating app
Yeah 

### Korogoro
I don't know how to name things so I ended up calling it korogoro. This is meant to be an application that would fix all the frustrations I, and my peers, have with scorion.

*What is Scorion?* 

Scorion is the application that is being used for grading and handing in assignments for various institutions in the country (the Netherlands).
Some issues with this application
- security is very bad
- UX is terrible
- UI looks outdated / bad
- people from my course are adding functionality to the application by basically injecting javascript?

## HOBBIES
Any professional is interested in personal hobbies so I will write down a list of things I enjoy doing.

- Procastringating, this is a made up word
- Playing guitar
- Telling people I do not like music but then I actually kind of do so I end up being an embarassment
- I study Japanese when I feel like it, but recently I haven't been feeling it to be honest


## Rambling about things I like
- Trying new foods at restaurants with good chef people
- same goes for the cafe's
- I will deny any accusations about me being a 'yup' or a 'hipster' 
- I am getting off-track so let me continue this list with things I like
- climbing
- software and frameworks that are in beta such as qwik and solidstart
- it's not them being in beta that I like but more that I enjoy new frameworks and technologies popping up and being able to experiment with them
- as for frameworks I really enjoy astro and sveltekit as well.
- nextjs and nuxtjs are fine.
- I enjoy not taking medication but I don't mind taking medication
- I probably should medicate right now
